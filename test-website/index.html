        <h2>Who was Marcus Aurelius?</h2>
        <p>
          Marcus Aurelius Antoninus (121–180 CE) was Roman emperor from 161 to 180 CE and is often
          remembered as history’s clearest example of a philosopher king. While leading campaigns and
          governing a vast empire, he wrote private notes on character, mortality, and responsibility.

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Duty over comfort:</strong> He treated power as service, not privilege.</li>
          <li><strong>Reason over impulse:</strong> He practiced self-command in public life.</li>
          <li><strong>Virtue over fame:</strong> His writings focus on integrity, not applause.</li>
