  "analysis": "The project currently has a basic structure for a website about black holes. The theme should be cosmic and dark, with animated elements related to black holes. The CSS file needs to be completed with a dark, cosmic theme including animations for black hole visuals, swirling effects, and glowing elements. The HTML file needs to be completed with interactive planets, animated slides, and other sections related to black holes. The JavaScript file needs to be updated with functionality for the animated slides and other interactive elements.",
