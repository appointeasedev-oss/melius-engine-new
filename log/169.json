  "analysis": "The current project has a basic HTML structure with some CSS and JavaScript files. The theme is not yet focused on black holes, and there are no animated objects or slides related to black holes. The CSS file needs to be updated to include a cosmic theme with animations for black hole visuals, swirling effects, and glowing elements. The HTML file should include sections related to black holes, and the JavaScript file should handle the animations and interactions for these sections.",
