  "analysis": "The project uses shadcn/ui components with a default theme. The current UI appears to have a neutral/light theme without specific seasonal styling. For 'morden-summer', we should incorporate warm, vibrant colors, summer-themed illustrations, and light, airy design elements. The theme context suggests theming is already implemented, making it easier to apply seasonal changes.",
