  "analysis": "The current project has a basic HTML structure with minimal CSS styling and incomplete JavaScript functionality. The theme should be updated to reflect a black hole and cosmic theme with animated objects and slides. The CSS needs to include dark cosmic colors, black hole visuals, swirling effects, and glowing elements. The HTML should have sections for interactive planets and animated slides related to black holes.",
