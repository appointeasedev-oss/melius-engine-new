  "analysis": "The current project has a basic structure with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. The theme is not yet implemented for the black holes topic. The CSS file needs to be updated with a dark, cosmic theme, and animations for black hole visuals, swirling effects, and glowing elements. The HTML file should include a mobile-friendly navigation menu with a hamburger icon. The JavaScript file needs to be completed with proper event handlers and functionality for the new buttons and mobile menu toggle.",
