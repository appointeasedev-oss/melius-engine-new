  "analysis": "The project is a static website about black holes with a focus on animations and interactive elements. The current theme is cosmic and dark, with swirling effects and glowing elements. The website includes a navigation menu, slides, and interactive buttons. The CSS file needs to be completed with the full intended dark, cosmic theme, including animations for black hole visuals, swirling effects, and glowing elements. The HTML file needs to be completed with mobile-friendly navigation and proper event handlers. The JavaScript file needs to be fixed for syntax errors and completed with all necessary functions.",
