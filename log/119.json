  "analysis": "The current project files related to the black holes theme are incomplete and lack the necessary animations and visual elements to create an immersive cosmic experience. The CSS file needs to be enhanced with dark, cosmic-themed colors, animations for black hole visuals, and swirling effects. The HTML file should include interactive elements such as animated slides and buttons with proper event handlers. The JavaScript file requires completion to ensure all functions are properly implemented and interactive elements are functional.",
