  "analysis": "The project uses a theme system with a ThemeContext and has a base CSS file. The current theme is not specified in the context, but for 'morden-summer', we should enhance the UI with warm, vibrant colors, summer-themed icons, and seasonal animations. The theme context likely controls the color scheme, so we should update it to include summer-specific colors.",
