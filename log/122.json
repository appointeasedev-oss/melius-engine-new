  "analysis": "The project is a static website about black holes with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. The theme should focus on a cosmic, dark aesthetic with animated elements related to black holes. The existing to-dos indicate that the CSS and JavaScript files need to be completed with animations and interactive elements. The HTML file should include sections about black holes, and the JavaScript should handle animations and mobile menu functionality.",
