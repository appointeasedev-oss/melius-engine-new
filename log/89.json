  "analysis": "The current project files contain a basic website structure with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The event.json specifies that the topic is black holes and the theme should include animated objects and slides. The existing to-dos mention a dark, cosmic theme with animations for black hole visuals, swirling effects, and glowing elements. The current CSS and JavaScript files need to be updated to reflect this theme and add the required animations.",
