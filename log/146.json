  "analysis": "The project is a web-based interactive page about black holes. The current state includes a basic HTML structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. The theme should be dark, cosmic, and include animations for black hole visuals, swirling effects, and glowing elements. The JavaScript needs to be updated to ensure all buttons have proper event handlers and functionality, and the CSS needs to be completed with the full intended dark, cosmic theme.",
