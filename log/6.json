  "analysis": "The project uses a modern UI library with components like buttons, cards, badges, and tabs. The theme is currently neutral with minimal summer-specific styling. The morden-summer event suggests adding warm, vibrant colors, gradients, and summer-themed visuals like sun, beach, or tropical elements. The main styling files are index.css and const.ts, which define colors and themes.",
