  "analysis": "The current project files for the test-website are focused on a black hole theme with animated elements and interactive features. The HTML file likely contains the structure for the black hole content, the CSS file is responsible for the dark, cosmic theme with animations, and the JavaScript file handles the interactive elements like the mobile menu and slide functionality. The theme should emphasize a cosmic, dark aesthetic with animations that reflect the nature of black holes, such as swirling effects and glowing elements. The mobile menu should be user-friendly and responsive.",
