  "analysis": "The project currently has a basic HTML structure with incomplete CSS and JavaScript files. The theme is intended to be about black holes with animated objects and slides. The CSS needs to be enhanced with a dark, cosmic theme including animations for black hole visuals, swirling effects, and glowing elements. The JavaScript needs to be completed to ensure all functions are properly implemented, especially for the animated slides and mobile menu.",
