  "analysis": "The project currently lacks a black hole-themed UI with animated objects and slides. The existing files (test-website/styles.css, test-website/index.html, test-website/script.js) need updates to incorporate a cosmic theme with animations for black hole visuals, swirling effects, and glowing elements. The current CSS and HTML files are incomplete and do not reflect the black hole theme.",
