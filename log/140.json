  "analysis": "The project is a black holes themed website with interactive elements. The current files include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the main content, styles, and functionality. The theme should focus on a cosmic, dark aesthetic with animations related to black holes, such as swirling effects, glowing elements, and animated slides. The CSS needs to be completed to fully implement the dark, cosmic theme, and the JavaScript should ensure all interactive elements are functional.",
